# Greater Tokyo Area Maps

These are maps collected (around December 2016) from various transit agencies for the sole purpose of navigating around Tokyo. Where possible, I've merged the original Japanese map alongside the English translated version into a single file.

Naming convention:

1. All maps are prefixed with two digits so that the most useful maps appear first when the files are listed alphabetically.
2. Each filename succinctly describes what transit system or bus/rail company the map is for.

## Miscellaneous Notes

- The file for the [Keisei Lines](https://github.com/normful/Greater_Tokyo_Area_Maps/blob/master/04_Keisei_Lines_(Narita).pdf) also has attached maps of Narita Airport showing where the Keisei kiosks are, in case you're visiting Japan for the first time without an IC card and need to buy a paper ticket for the first time. This map will be the first one you'll need to use if you're flying into Tokyo via Narita Airport and are taking one of the trains on the Keisei Lines into Tokyo.
- Some general guides are also included with the `99_` filename prefix.
